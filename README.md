I DONOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THE VIDEOS, IMAGES OR MUSIC USED IN THIS WEBSITE. 
VIDEOS: Amazing edits I found on  youtube and clipped them or gifs converted to mp4.

The tutorial of making this website is made by the amazing Adrian from Javascript Mastery on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9r5zTllx4&t=1298s)

I tried to combine my passion of anime and web design, in the way I learned a lot about tailwind, gsap and obv react and added my own tweaks to the project to give it a personal feel.
